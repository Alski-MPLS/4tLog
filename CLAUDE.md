# Contributor Notes

This file keeps a compact, public-facing orientation for contributors working in this
repository.

## What 4tlog Does

4tlog is a Flask application for interacting with FortiAnalyzer over its JSON-RPC API.
The main user-facing features are:

- Dashboard health cards backed by a background cache
- Log Search with FAZ-side filters and client-side export
- Admin pages for users, groups, targets, and logs

The Flask app is the primary interface. The Ansible playbook in `ansible/` remains as a
secondary CLI and reference path.

## Repository Layout

- `app/` contains the Flask app, route handlers, FAZ client, health cache, and static UI assets.
- `app/routes/` holds blueprint modules for auth, dashboard, admin, and log search.
- `tests/` contains the pytest suite.
- `ansible/` contains the legacy playbook and its documentation.
- `api-info/` contains FortiAnalyzer reference material used during development.
- `docs/` contains deployment guidance and contributor-facing design summaries.

## Runtime Data

Local runtime files are intentionally excluded from version control:

- `.env`
- `users.json`
- `groups.json`
- `faz_targets.json`
- `certs/`

Seed them from the corresponding example files before running the app.

## Development Commands

```bash
uv sync
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest -q
uv run python wsgi.py
```

## Contributor Expectations

- Keep changes focused and add tests for behavior changes.
- Do not commit secrets, local vault files, or live tokens.
- Prefer updating example files and docs when setup or operator workflows change.
- Preserve the cached Dashboard model so requests do not block on live FAZ polling.
